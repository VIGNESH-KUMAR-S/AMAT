# Data Structures   [DataStructure](https://www.javatpoint.com/data-structure-introduction)
- Data structure is the way of organizing data so that data can be used effectively.
- It's basically used for arranging data in a good manner so that accessing that data will become easy.

- **Primitive data structures** are primitive data types. The int, char, float, double, and pointer are the primitive data structures that can hold a single value.
- The arrangement of data in a sequential manner is known as a **linear data structure**. In these data structures, one element is connected to only one another element in a linear form.
- When one element is connected to the 'n' number of elements known as a **non-linear data structure**. In this case, the elements are arranged in a random manner.
- **Static data structure:** It is a type of data structure where the size is allocated at the compile time. Therefore, the maximum size is fixed.
- **Dynamic data structure:** It is a type of data structure where the size is allocated at the run time. Therefore, the maximum size is flexible.
